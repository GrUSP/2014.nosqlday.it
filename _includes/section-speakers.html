During this talk we will explore  NoSQL technologies on Azure and how to choose the right service to manage your non-relational data, which includes unstructured or particularly large data sets often referred to as 'big data'. Azure provides the ability to run on proven and well known NoSQL technologies on top of its Infrastructure Services, as well as third party PaaS offerings and first-party data stores for key-value, document, column-based. We will try and explore the capabilities of those and how to evaluate the tradeoff between a platform service and a 'run your own NoSql' database approach.">NoSQL why and how on Microsoft Azure</a></h4>

This company performs the processing of thousands of images every day and we have chosen Riak to be their data storage, which is currently filled with 2TB of data and still expanding. We have structured Riak to be able to serve images quickly and to be scaled rapidly following the data flow during time. Beyond its capabilities, and tuned parameters, we will talk about infrastructure and optimization, monitoring and disaster recovery, rolling upgrades and custom backup solutions. Moreover, we are starting the upgrading stage to riak 2.0, so we will give some hints about the enhancements that we had the chance to see.">Overflowing image storage with Riak</a></h4>
